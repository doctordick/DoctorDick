        question: "What’s Doctor D? ",
        answer: "Doctor D is a tool that gay guys can use to stay on top of their sexual health. Doctor D can gay guys  know which HIV and/or STD tests they need, which vaccinations related to sexual health they need, and whether they should consider PrEP.  "
      },

      {
        question: "Who should use Doctor D?",
        answer: "Doctor Dick is meant for all gay guys and guys who have sex with other guys." 
      },

      {
        question: "How much does Doctor D cost?",
        answer: "Nothing! You can use Doctor D for free. "
      },

      {
        question: "When should someone use Doctor D?",
        answer: "Use Doctor D when you’re feeling healthy, in order to know how you can best stay that way. Doctor D can help you know when you should get tested, when to get vaccinations for sexual health, and whether you should consider PrEP. "
      },

      {
        question: "When should someone *NOT* use Doctor D?",
        answer: "If you have any symptoms of disease, don’t use Doctor D. Seek medical help immediately, either by calling your doctor, or – if it’s an emergency – going to the emergency room or calling 911. Symptoms of disease include discharge from your penis, pain with urination, sore throat, rectal pain, fever, chills, or rash. "
      },

      {
        question: "Why can’t I just ask my doctor to give me what I need?",
        answer: "You can – and you should! As you might know, some health recommendations for gay guys are different than for straight guys or women. But often gay guys, even if they know that, don’t know exactly what the recommendations are. Unfortunately, sometimes their doctors don’t either. Doctors sometimes don’t take the time or have the comfort, knowledge, or experience to know about the sexual health needs for gay men. That’s where Doctor Dick can help – by empowering you to know what’s specifically recommended for you, where you can get it, and when you next need it."
      },

      {
        question: "How does Doctor D know what to ask and which recommendations to make?",
        answer: "Doctor Dick uses guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other public health agencies to know which questions to ask and which recommendations to make. Our team, with the help of our medical advisory board, continually reviews both the questions Doctor Dick asks and the recommendations that Doctor Dick makes."
      },

      {
        question: "How does Doctor D work?",
        answer: "Doctor Dick asks you questions about your medical history and sexual behaviors. Using that information, Doctor Dick provides customized recommendations related to sexual health in four areas: HIV testing, sexually transmitted disease (STD) testing, vaccines, and PrEP. Doctor Dick also allows you to search for clinics where you can get the sexual health services you need. Finally, Doctor Dick allows you to set reminders, so that you remember when next to go back for tests, vaccines, or other services."
      },

      {
        question: "Why are there four different areas that Doctor D asks about? ",
        answer: "There are four different areas — HIV testing, STD testing, vaccines, and PrEP — because recommendations in these areas are different for gay men. Some don’t apply to all guys, but you might not know until you answer some questions. Be sure to go through all four areas."
      },

      {
        question: "Will Doctor D tell me everything I need to know about my health?",
        answer: "No. Doctor Dick is focused on sexual health — specifically, HIV testing, STD testing, vaccines, and PrEP. Doctor Dick doesn’t cover other aspects of health, like getting your blood pressure or cholesterol checked, getting a colonoscopy, or other health issues that aren’t related to sexual health. Like everyone else, gay guys have health needs that go beyond sexual health. Ask your doctor not only about your sexual health needs but about your general health needs too."
      },

      {
        question: "Does it matter if I answer Doctor D’s questions truthfully?",
        answer: "Yes, it does. It’s important to answer all of the questions truthfully. If you don’t answer truthfully, Doctor Dick won’t be able to provide reliable recommendations. And that’s not good for your health!"
      },

      {
        question: "How does Doctor D protect my personal information?",
        answer: "Dotor Dick takes your health information very seriously. Doctor Dick does not store any of the information you provide anywhere besides your phone. Doctor Dick does not share any of the information you provide with anyone else. While we are very concerned with safeguarding your information and employ reasonable measures to do that, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute security."
      },

      {
        question: "Can I use Doctor D on my other mobile phones, or on other devices linked to my phone?",
        answer: "Yes, you can use the app on other linked mobile phones or devices. All information provided to Doctor D stays on the device on which you installed Doctor D. You will not be able to access your account information on multiple devices. In the event you change mobile phones or reinstall the application on your device, you will not be able to recover your information, since we do not store your data."

      {
        question: "What’s HIV? ",
        answer: "HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens a person’s immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. No effective cure exists for HIV. But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. Some groups of people in the United States, such as gay men and other guys who have sex with guys, are more likely to get HIV than others because of many factors, including their sex partners, their risk behaviors, and where they live. Sometimes only a blood test can tell whether someone has HIV. Sexually active gay men who are not known to be HIV-positive should be tested regularly for HIV. \n\nFor more information on HIV, ask your doctor or go here (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/msm/)."
      }, 

      {
        question: "What’s syphilis? ",
        answer: "Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can have very serious complications when left untreated, but it is simple to cure with the right treatment. You can get syphilis by direct contact with a syphilis sore during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Sores can be found on the penis, vagina, anus, in the rectum, or on the lips and in the mouth. Sometimes only a blood test can tell whether someone has syphilis. Sexually active gay men should be tested regularly for syphilis. \n\nFor more information on syphilis, ask your doctor or go here (http://www.cdc.gov/std/syphilis/stdfact-msm-syphilis.htm)."
      },

      {
        question: "What’s gonorrhea? ",
        answer: "Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can infect the urethra (the part of the penis that passes the urine), the rectum (butt), and the throat. It can have serious complications, but it is simple to cure with the right treatment. Sexually active gay men should be regularly tested for gonorrhea at each site (urethra, rectum, and throat) where they have sex. \n\nFor more information on gonorrhea, ask your doctor or go here (http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/stdfact-gonorrhea.htm)."

        question: "What’s hepatitis A? ",
        answer: "Hepatitis A is a contagious liver disease that results from infection with the Hepatitis A virus. It can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. Hepatitis A is usually spread when a person ingests fecal matter — even in microscopic amounts — from contact with objects, food, or drinks contaminated by the feces, or stool, of an infected person. Rimming and other sex practices that involve contact between the mouth and the anal area can lead to infection. All gay men should be vaccinated against hepatitis A unless they have been previously infected with hepatitis A. \n\nFor more information on hepatitis A, ask your doctor or go here (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hav/afaq.htm#overview)."
      },

      {
        question: "What’s hepatitis B? ",
        answer: "Hepatitis B is a liver infection caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV). Hepatitis B is transmitted when blood, semen, or another body fluid from a person infected with the Hepatitis B virus enters the body of someone who is not infected. This can happen through sexual contact; sharing needles, syringes, or other drug-injection equipment; or from mother to baby at birth. For some people, hepatitis B is an acute, or short-term, illness but for others, it can become a long-term, chronic infection. Chronic Hepatitis B can lead to serious health issues, like cirrhosis or liver cancer. All gay men should get vaccinated against hepatitis B unless they have been infected or are currently infected with hepatitis B. \n\nFor more information on hepatitis B, ask your doctor or go here (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hbv/bfaq.htm)."
      },

      {
        question: "What’s hepatitis C? ",
        answer: "Hepatitis C is a liver infection caused by the Hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus. Today, most people become infected with the Hepatitis C virus by sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs. For some people, hepatitis C is a short-term illness but for 70%–85% of people who become infected with Hepatitis C, it becomes a long-term, chronic infection. Chronic Hepatitis C is a serious disease than can result in long-term health problems, even death. The majority of infected persons might not be aware of their infection because they are not clinically ill. There is no vaccine for Hepatitis C. The best way to prevent Hepatitis C is by avoiding behaviors that can spread the disease, especially injecting drugs. Gay men living with HIV should be tested regularly for hepatitis C. \n\nFor more information on hepatitis C, ask your doctor or go here (http://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/hcv/cfaq.htm)."
      },

      {
        question: "What’s PrEP?",
        answer: "re-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, is a way for people who do not have HIV but who are at substantial risk of getting it to prevent HIV infection by taking a pill every day. The pill (brand name Truvada) contains two medicines (tenofovir and emtricitabine) that are used in combination with other medicines to treat HIV. When someone is exposed to HIV through sex or injection drug use, these medicines can work to keep the virus from establishing a permanent infection. \n\n When taken consistently, PrEP has been shown to reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at high risk by up to 92%. PrEP is much less effective if it is not taken consistently. \n\nPrEP is a powerful HIV prevention tool and can be combined with condoms and other prevention methods to provide even greater protection than when used alone. But people who use PrEP must commit to taking the drug every day and seeing their health care provider for follow-up every 3 months. \n\nFor more information on PrEP, ask your doctor or go here (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/prep/)."
      },

      {
        question: "What’s PEP?",
        answer: "PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) means taking antiretroviral medicines (ART) after being potentially exposed to HIV to prevent becoming infected. \n\nPEP should be used only in emergency situations and must be started within 72 hours after a recent possible exposure to HIV. If you think you’ve recently been exposed to HIV during sex or through sharing needles and works to prepare drugs or if you’ve been sexually assaulted, talk to your health care provider or an emergency room doctor about PEP right away. \n\nFor more information on PEP, ask your doctor or go here (http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/pep.html)."
